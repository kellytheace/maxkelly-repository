    <p>A collection of tools and models I've built for mathematical and financial analysis. Chess engines and other simulations are also included.</p>
    <p>This site serves as a personal library for showcasing coding projects focused on mathematical challenges, actuarial science, financial modeling & data analysis - all handwritten in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with other programming languages used for specific projects.</p>
    <p>In addition, this collection also features chess engines, simulations & models. Each project includes code, a short write-up, and visual outputs when relevant.</p>
